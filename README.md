## Side notes from repository maintainer

- I just like to play Last Epoch and miss theorycrafting tools for it.
- I picked Flutter as a cross-platform framework for desktop applications. Neither Dart is my primary language, nor
  mobile/desktop apps are my areas of interests. Sometimes you may notice foolish code patterns & inconsistencies â€”
  don't hesitate to send a PR or provide a constructive critique.
- I was inspired by PoE's Path Of Building, but decided not to contribute to its fork specialized for the Last Epoch.
  I am too lazy / it is too complex for me to learn the code and do a massive refactoring in Lua code, which doesn't run
  in dev environment I like (Linux/MacOS).
- Core values of the codebase and the resulting program: maintainability, correctness, performance. In that order.
- Be a decent person regardless of who you are.
