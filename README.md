# Last Epoch Theorycraft

A cross-platform tool for Last Epoch build theorycrafting.

Inspired by capabilities of [Path of Building](https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding).

## Side notes from repository maintainer

- I picked Flutter as a cross-platform framework for desktop applications. Neither Dart is my primary language, nor
  mobile/desktop apps are my areas of interests. I just like to play Last Epoch and miss theorycrafting tools for
  the builds I like, and especially defenses.
- I was inspired by PoE's Path Of Building idea, but decided not to contribute to it's fork for the Last Epoch.
  I am too lazy / it is too complex for me to learn the code and do a massive refactoring in Lua code, which doesn't run
  in dev environment I like (Linux/MacOS).
- Core values of the codebase and the resulting program: maintainability, correctness, performance. In that order.
- Be a decent person.
